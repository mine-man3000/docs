## Installing Linux
Thanks to recent advancements in the chrultrabook community, Linux works really well on most Chromebooks.

### Installation:
1. Create a Linux (Fedora/Arch/Debian 12) USB. Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros have outdated packages and thus are not supported.
2. Plug the USB Drive into the chromebook.
3. Turn on the chromebook, and let it boot the USB drive.
4. install as you would on any other computer.
